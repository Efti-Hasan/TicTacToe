# TicTacToe
A simple **TicTacToe** game built with **Java** using the **Swing** framework. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) where two players (Player X and Player O) take turns marking spots on a 3x3 grid. The game detects winners, tracks scores, and allows for restarting after each round.

## Features

- **Custom Player Names**: Players can choose their names for Player X and Player O.
- **Real-time Game Status**: The game shows whose turn it is and announces the winner.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score for both players.
- **Game Restart**: You can restart the game anytime with a click of the "Restart Game" button.
- **Automatic Win Detection**: The game checks for winning conditions (3 Xs or Os in a row) and highlights the winning combination.

## How to Play

1. When you start the game, you'll be asked to enter names for **Player X** and **Player O**.
2. **Player X** always goes first. Players take turns clicking empty spots on the 3x3 grid.
3. The game will check for a winner after each move. A player wins if they align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
4. If the board is full and no one wins, the game announces a tie.
5. After a game (win or tie), you can restart the game using the "Restart Game" button.
